# Arithmetic Operators

### Probem description

The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, `a` and `b`. Add code to print three lines where:

1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.


**Example**

    Input: 
    a = 3 
    b = 5

    Output: 
    8
    -2
    15

**Constraints:**

${1 <= a <= 10^{10}} $
${1 <= b <= 10^{10}} $
